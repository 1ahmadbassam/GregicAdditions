# GregicAdditions Unofficial
A mod intended to make [GregTech Community Edition](https://github.com/GregTechCE/GregTech) harder and more realistic by incorporating
GT5U and GT6 features.

## [CurseForge Release](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregicadditions-unofficial/)

## Description

**If you find a bug, [please let me know](https://github.com/1ahmadbassam/GregicAdditionsUnofficial/issues)!**

This mod is a fork of the original GregicAdditions by TheLimePixel, which was originally
intended to update the mod to end-of-life GTCE 1.17, but is now focusing on adding more integrations
and enhancing codebase.

Most ideas of this mod are implemented in the popular modpack [GregBlock](https://github.com/1ahmadbassam/Gregblock-revamped117) 
(which is currently under updating as well, by me).
Some of the design features of this mod are most fitting in GregBlock; however, this mod is fully
standalone and configuration options for most options are provided.

In case you are thinking that most of the features of this mod are in GTCE, then you may be thinking of [GTCEu](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech). 
Because of the aforementioned reason, GregBlock and its mods are currently stuck on GTCE (which includes this mod).

For GTCE Tinker's Construct integration, check out [Greg's Construct Unofficial](https://github.com/1ahmadbassam/GregsConstructUnofficial).

For extended Forestry integration, check out [GTCEBees](https://github.com/1ahmadbassam/GTCEBees).
