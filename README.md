## The Fork
This fork completes modernization of original GregicAdditions to 1.17 GTCE (since Shadows of Greg removes essential items for GregBlock to actually work, so it cannot be used).
Libs:
```
GTCEBees-1.12.2-1.0.5.jar (custom build, can be found on my fork)
```

Note: I have modified ```gradlew.bat``` to point to Java 8 on my system since my Java home is 17. If you want to build this, make sure to change that to the directory of Java 8 on your machine.
